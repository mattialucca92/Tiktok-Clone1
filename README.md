# TikTok Clone

The application aims to be a TikTok clone... obviously in an educational form.
I used JavaScript to make my app dynamic, also through the use of APIs.
My goal was to successfully implement APIs (since I'm currently studying them). Unfortunately, not all videos have audio, but that wasnâ€™t important to me... For me, the main thing was being able to write code and make the application work.
